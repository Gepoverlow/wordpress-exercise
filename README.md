What was the exercise about:
Take the first steps towards getting to know and understand WordPress

My take:
I personally did not enjoy this assignment at first. After 7 hours of bashing my head against the keyboard trying to move blocks around a page like a designer wanna-be, I came to the conclusion that I disliked it more than I thought.

Generally speaking, humans dont like change, and the use of this tool implicated a big change on the ways something is done, and after months of building pages by code it was hard for me to adapt to it in such short notice.

This doesnt mean that WordPress is bad. It is just targeted to a diferent group of people that I currently dont identify myself in. Surely with enough practice and consistency I could become a proficient wordpress developer (Even though I really just scratched the tip of the iceberg).
